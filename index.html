        Place your real Bullmastiff photo here – ideally a calm adult dog in a normal home, not a show-ring glamour shot.
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Buying a Bullmastiff is not like buying a random mixed-breed puppy from a classifieds ad.
          You’re choosing a 50–70 kg guardian who will live in your house for the next 8–10 years.
          A good choice means a mostly chill family dog. A bad choice can mean health problems, fear,
          aggression, or a dog you simply can’t handle.
        </p>

        <div class="tip-box">
          <strong>Blunt note:</strong> If the breeder is pushing you to “decide today” or seems more interested in
          your money than your lifestyle, walk away. There are always more puppies. There is only one you.
        </div>

        <h2>Step 1 – Be brutally honest about why you want a Bullmastiff</h2>
        <p>
          Before you even write to a breeder, be clear about what you actually want from this dog.
          “Big and cool looking” is not a good enough reason. Bullmastiffs were created as silent
          guardians, not decorative furniture.
        </p>
        <h3>Questions to ask yourself</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Do I want a family dog first, or a serious guard dog?</li>
          <li>How much real time do I have for training in the first 12 months?</li>
          <li>Am I ready for drool, hair, vet bills and a dog that may out-weigh my partner?</li>
          <li>Am I okay saying “no” to a breeder if something feels off?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your answers will decide which breeder and which bloodlines make sense for you.
          Some lines are softer and more “pet type,” others are sharper and more suspicious.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 2 – What a good Bullmastiff breeder actually looks like</h2>
        <p>
          A real breeder is obsessed with health, temperament and the future of the breed –
          not with moving puppies as fast as possible. They should be able to explain exactly why
          they chose this male and this female, and what they expect from the litter.
        </p>

        <h3>Green flags (good signs)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>They ask <strong>you</strong> more questions than you ask them.</li>
          <li>They are happy to show contracts, registration papers and health test results.</li>
          <li>Dogs live as part of the family, not in filthy kennels.</li>
          <li>They can talk for 20 minutes about temperament, not only show wins.</li>
          <li>They are honest about problems they’ve had in previous litters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Red flags – do not ignore these</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>No health tests, or “my vet said they are healthy so no need”.</li>
          <li>Many different breeds on the same yard (“kennel of everything”).</li>
          <li>No contract, no questions, “just send deposit and pick up.”</li>
          <li>Constant ads on classifieds sites with puppies always available.</li>
          <li>Refusing to let you see where the dogs live.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="ad-slot">
          In-article ad placeholder<br />(e.g. responsive AdSense unit once you monetise)
        </div>

        <h2>Step 3 – Health tests you should ask for (and why they matter)</h2>
        <p>
          Bullmastiffs are prone to hip and elbow problems, certain cancers, heart issues and bloat.
          Health tests do not guarantee a perfect dog, but they dramatically improve your odds.
        </p>
        <h3>Basic checks to expect</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Hips and elbows:</strong> official scoring (e.g. FCI, OFA, BVA). Both parents should be
            better than the average for the breed in your country.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Heart:</strong> preferably checked by a cardiologist, not just a quick listen at a normal vet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Eyes where applicable:</strong> any known eye issues in the line should be discussed openly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Basic bloodwork:</strong> not mandatory everywhere, but a good sign if the breeder does it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a breeder gets defensive when you ask for proof, that’s your answer. A serious breeder will
          be proud to send you scans or links to public databases with their dogs’ results.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 4 – Temperament and bloodlines: not all “big heads” are equal</h2>
        <p>
          Photos on social media tell you almost nothing. You need to know what the dogs are like
          in daily life: in the house, with visitors, with kids, around other dogs.
        </p>
        <h3>Things to ask and observe</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How do the parents behave when you arrive? Solid, curious, but under control is ideal.</li>
          <li>Are there relatives living as normal family dogs, not only on farms or in kennels?</li>
          <li>Does the breeder warn you about any “sharpness” or same-sex aggression in the line?</li>
          <li>Do they describe puppies as “strong character, not for beginners” and still want to sell to you?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There is nothing wrong with stronger, more serious dogs – if you are ready for them.
          But most people who google “Bullmastiff” actually want a stable, lazy sofa guardian,
          not a project dog.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 5 – Contracts, price, and not getting manipulated</h2>
        <p>
          A good contract protects both sides. It should clearly explain what happens if the dog
          has a serious hereditary issue, what the breeder guarantees, and what they expect from you
          (for example: not breeding without permission).
        </p>
        <h3>Normal vs suspicious pricing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Too cheap = usually corners were cut somewhere (health, socialisation, ethics).</li>
          <li>Very expensive with zero transparency = paying for marketing, not quality.</li>
          <li>Good breeders sit somewhere in the middle, and can explain their price calmly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Remember: you are not buying a TV. You are choosing a living animal that will depend on you
          every single day. If something feels off in your gut, it probably is.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 6 – Saying “no” is a power move, not an insult</h2>
        <p>
          You are allowed to leave. You are allowed to say “thank you, but this is not for me”
          even if you already drove three hours and looked at the puppies. Your future self will
          thank you for walking away from a bad situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A good breeder will also tell <em>you</em> “no” if they think you’re not a match.
          That might sting in the moment, but it’s actually a sign that they care about
          where their puppies go.
